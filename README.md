**Estimate Databricks workload costs in minutes—with transparent assumptions you can review, share, and export.**

Lakemeter is an open-source cost estimation and workload sizing tool that runs as a **Databricks App** with built-in SSO. Configure expected usage, calculate regional costs, and export a detailed Excel estimate instead of maintaining sizing spreadsheets by hand.

## Fork notes (suneelsunkara-db)

This fork tracks upstream [databrickslabs/lakemeter-oss](https://github.com/databrickslabs/lakemeter-oss) and adds a few changes so the AI assistant works on **Databricks Free Edition**:

- **2026-07-27 — Free Edition AI model.** The AI assistant model endpoint defaults to `databricks-qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct` (a Foundation Model endpoint available on Free Edition) instead of a Claude endpoint that isn't provisioned there. The endpoint remains configurable via the `CLAUDE_MODEL_ENDPOINT` env var / installer `claude_endpoint` parameter.
- **2026-07-27 — Removed hardcoded model in the agent.** `create_agent()` no longer hardcodes a Claude endpoint; it uses the configured `CLAUDE_MODEL_ENDPOINT`, fixing `404 ENDPOINT_NOT_FOUND` on workspaces where that endpoint doesn't exist.
- **2026-09-18 — Re-synced with upstream.** Rebased the fork onto the latest upstream `main` (which already prefers the app service principal token for model serving) and kept only the Free Edition model changes above to avoid duplicating upstream fixes.

## Why Lakemeter

- **Transparent calculations** — Review usage quantities, billing units, SKUs, rates, VM costs, storage, and discounts behind every total.
- **Workload-specific sizing** — Use forms tailored to each supported Databricks workload rather than a generic calculator.
- **AI-assisted estimates** — Describe a workload in natural language, review the suggested configuration, and accept it with one click.
- **Excel export** — Generate a detailed workbook for customer conversations, procurement reviews, RFPs, and internal planning.
- **Cloud and region awareness** — Model the cloud, region, tier, and pricing options available in the app.
- **Built for teams** — Create, duplicate, share, and compare multi-workload estimates in a Databricks workspace.

## Quick start

You need a Databricks workspace and a configured [Databricks CLI profile](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/cli/profiles.html).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/databrickslabs/lakemeter-oss.git
cd lakemeter-oss

./scripts/install.sh --profile <your-cli-profile>
```

The one-command installer provisions Lakebase, loads pricing data, deploys the app, and verifies the installation. It typically completes in **5–15 minutes**.

For permissions, deployment inventory, non-interactive installation, and troubleshooting, see the [installation guide](https://databrickslabs.github.io/lakemeter-oss/admin-guide/installer).

Add workload assumptions and calculate their estimated cost:
